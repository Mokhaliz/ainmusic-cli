# AinMusic

Hey, back then I wrote some python scripts to download music from youtube for my personal usage.

Then I thought why not share these scripts to I did a little bit of refactoring and add argparse to project.

**Note:** As I said, this is for my personal usage so I dont have plans to develop and maintain this repository and I just wanted to share my code. so feel free to contribute and pull requests are welcome :)
